# Pasteurization-of-Canned-Foods-Using-CFD
This project investigates the pasteurization of canned food products using (CFD). The process involves heating sealed cans in hot water to deactivate enzymes and microorganisms, followed by rapid cooling. The study focuses on analyzing heat transfer behavior across different can sizes to evaluate thermal resistance pasteurization efficiency.
